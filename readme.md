Impact Classification System
----------------------------

The IMP+ACT Classification System (ICS) is a free self-assessment and reporting tool for investment practitioners wanting to integrate impact into their investment decisions, investment practice and performance analysis.
 
As of May 2021, the IP and Code for the ICS has become available on Github (MIT licence) to enable investment practitioners and data providers to seamlessly integrate and multiplicate the classification process into their own solutions.
